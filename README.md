The "Layr Figma Contribution React App" is a web application developed using React, designed to enhance the functionality and user experience related to contributions in the context of Figma design collaboration. Here's a breakdown of its key features:

### Layr Figma Contribution: 
This suggests that the app is specifically built to work with Figma, a popular web-based design and prototyping tool. It likely integrates with Figma's APIs or services to gather data related to contributions.

### React App: 
The application is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React is known for its performance, modularity, and the ability to create interactive web applications.

### Charts like Bar Graphs: 
The app incorporates data visualization elements, including bar graphs. Bar graphs are effective for displaying contributions data as they allow users to quickly understand the distribution and relative sizes of contributions made by different users or over time.

### Visualize Contributions: 
The primary function of the app is to enable users to visualize and understand contributions within the context of Figma. This could include tracking changes made to design files, comments, updates, or any other form of user input within Figma.

### Filters for Users: 
The app provides a filtering mechanism that allows users to refine the displayed data according to different user-related criteria. This is useful for isolating specific contributions or gaining insights into the contributions of particular team members, collaborators, or groups.
